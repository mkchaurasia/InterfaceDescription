# InterfaceDescription
Create Interface Descriptions from CDP Neighbor Output

Most customers want interface descriptions on core switch ports that are connected to edge switches 
and edge switch ports that are connected to access points or other critical devices. When you are 
doing a green field design this is usually pretty easy and you can include the descriptions in your 
spreadsheet data and they are automatically inserted when you run the template.
